I want to do two things here: 

* choose the parameters of `func0` - see `entry.lisp` and  
* work out how to read blocks of memory which has been `malloc`'d and then initialised - e.g. to fill out struct data - see the very simple attempt in `memory_read.lisp`.  

I'm still working out how to do all of this in the most efficient way. Plus, I barely know Lisp at all. 
I'll write a summary once I get something neat and tidy together.
