I want to do two things here: 
(1) choose the parameters of `func0` - see `entry.lisp` and  
(2) work out how to read blocks of memory which has been malloc'd and then initialised - e.g. to fill out struct data - see the very simple attempt in memory_read.lisp.  

I'm still working out how to do all of this in the most efficient way. Plus, I barely know Lisp at all.
