I'm learning to code in OCaml and Lisp.  You won't find masterful code here - aside from snippets taken from skilled programmers - just my plodding forth to learn each of these languages.

By the way, `Land of Lisp` is a great book.  I rarely read a computing textbook from cover-to-cover, but this book is quite fun to work through.  https://cs.gmu.edu/~sean/lisp/LispTutorial.html also helps you to hit the ground running.
